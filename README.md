# Volvo campaign test
Test automation project for Volvo safety campaign that covers the page https://www.volvocars.com/intl/v/car-safety/a-million-more.

The test automation project consists of 4 suites, that are executed in parallel. Those suites are:
- Header 
- Car safety page
- Explore car models 
- Footer

The Header, Footer and Explore car models section are displayed in many other pages and are therefore a separate suite, so they can be reusable.
