# Volvo campaign test
Test automation project for Volvo safety campaign that covers the page https://www.volvocars.com/intl/v/car-safety/a-million-more.

## Test suites
The test automation project consists of 4 suites (located in /specs folder), that are executed in parallel. Those suites are:
- Car safety page
- Explore car models 
- Header
- Footer

The Explore car models, header and footor sections are all displayed in many other pages and are therefore a separate suite, so they can be in future made reusable.

## Test data
The test data for Explore car models is stored in JSON files in /data folder.

## How to run
